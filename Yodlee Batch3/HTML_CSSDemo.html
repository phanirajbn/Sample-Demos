        </header>
        <section>
            <p> CSS 3.0 is a new way of formatting UR Content of HTML pages in a simplified and easy manner. CSS Contains one or more selectors thro which U could apply the styles for the Elements. A Style typically contains a block of formatting features that U wish to incorporate into the elements. Styles can be set inline, external or internal. Preferably go for External Styling unless U R working with dynamic content which is to be generated at Runtime.</p>

                    <li>Relative: Positions itself based on the previous or the next element that it is associated with. It might impact the positioning on the other elements that are lined in the HTML Document</li>
                    <li>Absolute: It positions itself to a fixed width, height and size and does not take into consideration about the other elements that are placed beside it.</li>
                    <li>Fixed: Makes the element non movable and will be there at a constant point even if the page is scrolled. This is typically required if U want to retain the element on all conditions.</li>
